# Bachelor Thesis
I developed my bachelor thesis working with the JUNO Padova group, which is responsible for the design and development of the large PMT readout electronics.
The main goal was to investigate the performances of the full electronics chain in terms of two of its main aspects: linearity of the ADC and time reconstruction.
